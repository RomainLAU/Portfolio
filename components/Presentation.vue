        Hi ! I'm <strong>Romain LAURENT</strong>, a french student in web
        development at <strong>Epitech Digital</strong> in Paris. I started
        coding 3 years ago, in 2019, by making little programs in
        <strong>Python</strong>. In 2020 I discovered the web development --
        with <strong>HTML, CSS and PHP</strong> -- and at this moment, I knew
        that was what I wanted to do later. I love to start new projects where I
        don't know how I will do it, but I just know I'll do it. I like to work
        during <strong>night</strong> to fully be in <strong>peace</strong>,
        when nobody can disturb me, and there only are my project and me. I have
        always loved colors (as you can see on my hair), and that is why I had
        an art class in high school. And this, is why, even if I'm a developer,
        I'm really interested in design and <strong>UX/UI</strong>.
